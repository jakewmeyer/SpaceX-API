# V2 Docs

## Introduction
This collection of documents describes the resources and functions that make up the r/SpaceX API. The documentation uses [api blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) for formatting.

## API Status
See the [status](https://status.spacexdata.com) page for more details

## Authentication
No authentication is required to use this public API

## Privacy
I do not log IP addresses or any personally identifiable information at the app or web server level. I collect timestamps,
HTTP methods, urls, and response times to adjust caching strategies on popular endpoints. Below is a sample log output:
```bash
[27/Aug/2018:00:42:06 +0000] "GET /v2/launches/latest HTTP/1.1" 200 - 51.478 ms
```

I do use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in front of the API. Please see their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details on data collection policies.

## Rate Limiting
The API has a rate limit of 50 req/sec per IP address, if exceeded, a response of 429 will be given
until the rate drops back below 50 req/sec

## Pretty Printing
JSON pretty printing is turned off by default to reduce payload size. It can be enabled by including
the querystring `pretty=true` in the url
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches/latest?pretty=true
```
